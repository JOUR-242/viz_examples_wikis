# Visualization Wiki Instructions

(20 points)
You are to find an interactive data visualization online. Your example can be from journalism or part of a brand’s content marketing or even part of a product like Mint or a home mortgage calculator; however, your example MUST collect some kind of user input to control, organize or sort data and must output a visualization (good places to start: NYTimes Interactives, NPR visuals).

You are to create a basic HTML file with headers, paragraphs, etc. presenting your example and explaining the following:
  
* A screenshot of the interactive
* A link to the interactive
* The input the interactive collects
* The output the interactive shows or delivers
* What “thinking” the program is doing
* What patterns, comparisons, trends, etc. the interactive is meant to demonstrate
* Describe any labels, legends and keys used in the visualization to demonstrate those patterns. How are they used? Why?
* How the interactivity enhances the story
* What important context is included and how
* What context is not included
  
You should host your HTML file on your iWeb account and add a URL to it to the course GitHub.
